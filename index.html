        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> My name is Jose Barajas, but everyone calls me Tony. I was born in Mexico but was transplanted into the
            United States at an early age.
            I have lived in Utah for the better part of 24 years so I definitely consider myself a Utahn and all the
            perks that come with it, fry-sauce comes to mind.
            Something most people would not know about me is that I am also Basque, Basque is a culture located right
            in between Spain and France, and I embrace this culture
            wholeheartedly. The Basque culture is rich with delicious food, dancing , and ancient traditions.

        </p>

        <p>Sci-fi movies and cheesy 80's action movies are my favorite like "Commando". I enjoy the outdoors and
            consider myself lucky to live in such a beautiful state.
            I know that when someone asks "what type of music do you like?" if someone answers that they like
            "everything" that they're just not beign honest. Yet I feel compelled to say
            that I do like everything from classical to metal music, from dub step to country music. I find that
            exposing yourself to new things can lead to great discoveries.
